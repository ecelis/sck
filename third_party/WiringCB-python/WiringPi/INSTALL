How to install wiringPi
=======================

The easiest way is to use the supplied 'build' script:

  ./build

that should do a complete install or upgrade of wiringPi for you.

That will install a dynamic library.

Some distributions do not have /usr/local/lib in the default LD_LIBRARY_PATH. To
fix this, you need to edit /etc/ld.so.conf and add in a single line:

  /usr/local/lib

then run the ldconfig command.

  sudo ldconfig

If you want to install a static library, you may need to do this manually:

  cd wiringPi
  make static
  sudo make install-static


To un-install wiringPi:

  ./build uninstall


I2C:

If your system has the correct i2c-dev libraries and headers installed,
then the I2C helpers will be compiled into wiringPi. If you want to
use the I2C helpers and don't have them installed, then under Raspbian,
issue the command:

  sudo apt-get install libi2c-dev

Consult the documentation for your system if you are not running Raspbian.
