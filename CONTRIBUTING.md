# Contributing to SCK

SCK is a one man effort and welcomes volunteers that find the project
useful, there is no need to be a programmer to contribute to SCK, one
important and missing part is documentation. So if you are not a coder,
feel free to contribute to get in touch and we will figure out how to
get that going.

### Get in Touch

* Join #sck IRC channel on irc.sdf.org

* Report bugs and open issues on https://github.com/ecelis/sck/issues

* Submit PRs, make sure to read the Guidelines below.

## Guidelines

1. Pick one of the open issues first and comment on it that you are
  interested in to taking it.

2. Open a PR and add a #issue reference to it (there will be in the
   PR template)

3. Work with me through the review process. Volunteer reviewers are
   welcome, please add a comment on the related issue and I'll make sure
   to add you.

On the technical side I suggest to follow the
[PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008) style guide. There is
some flexibility, since I wasn't a very good python programmer when
started the project (still I am not), but let's try hard to be strict.

## Testing

This project is not TDD, but minimal functional tests are required. It
is OK to write code first and tests later, PRs can be opened without
tests but they will be required at some point before merging, also I
will give priority to review PRs wich I can test first.

In fact, writing tests for the code already existing (only if it is
worth to keep) is a good first contribution and will get you to know the
code.


### Than you in advance for contributing! <3
